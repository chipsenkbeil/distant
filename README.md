Binary to connect with a remote machine to edit files and run programs.

ðŸš§ **(Alpha stage software) This program is in rapid development and may break or change frequently!** ðŸš§

## Details

The `distant` binary supplies both a server and client component as well as
a command to start a server and configure the local client to be able to
talk to the server.

- Asynchronous in nature, powered by [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs/)
- Data is serialized to send across the wire via [`CBOR`](https://cbor.io/)
- Encryption & authentication are handled via
  [XChaCha20Poly1305](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8439) for an authenticated
  encryption scheme via
  [RustCrypto/ChaCha20Poly1305](https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/tree/master/chacha20poly1305)

## Installation

## Examples

Launch a remote instance of `distant` by SSHing into another machine and
starting the `distant` executable:

```bash
# Connects to my.example.com on port 22 via SSH to start a new session
distant launch my.example.com

# After the session is established, you can perform different operations
# on the remote machine via `distant action {command} [args]`
distant action copy path/to/file new/path/to/file
distant action run -- echo 'Hello, this is from the other side'
