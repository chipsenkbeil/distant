## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New `environment` session type that prints out environment variable
  definitions for use in an interactive session or to evaluate
- Shell support introduced for ssh & distant servers, including a new shell
  command for distant cli
- Support for JSON communication of ssh auth during launch (cli)

- Expose `origin_id` of remote process as method
- Rename ProcRun -> ProcSpawn, ProcStarted -> ProcSpawned
- Update ProcStdin, ProcStdout, and ProcStderr to use list of bytes instead
  of a string as a parameter; RemoteProcess and RemoteLspProcess now support
  reading and writing using either `String` or `Vec<u8>`
- Rename `--detached` and associated to `--persist`

### Removed
- Github actions no longer use paths-filter so every PR & commit will test
  everything

## [0.15.1] - 2021-11-15
### Added
- `--key-from-stdin` option to listen cli command to read key from stdin
  instead of generating
- More logging to distant and ssh handler *proc run* methods

## [0.15.0] - 2021-10-16
### Added
- distant-ssh2 subcrate to provide an alternate session as an ssh client
- distant-lua subcrate for lua lib 
- `rpassword` & `wezterm-ssh` dependencies for distant-ssh2 and
  `XChaCha20Poly1305` dependency in place of `orion` for encryption
- `Codec` trait to support encode & decode
- `XChaCha20Poly1305Codec` that encrypts/signs using *XChaCha20Poly1305*
- `PlainCodec` that does no encrypting/signing
- `SessionChannelExt` trait for friendlier methods
- `Mailbox` and internal `PostOffice` to manage responses to requests
- Method parameter to support distant & ssh methods for action and lsp subcommands
- Support compiling distant cli on windows (#59)
- `status` method to `RemoteProcess`

### Changed
- Refactor Transport to take generic Codec
- Rewrite to no longer use blake256

    - serializable
    - deserializable

  subtypes as singular parameters
- Replace `--daemon` in favor of opposite parameter `--foreground`

### Removed
- `DistantCodec`
- `k256` dependency
- `Transport::from_handshake` as no longer doing *EDCH key exchange*

### Fixed
- Stdout/stderr being sent before *proc_start* by adding *post_hook* support
  to handler such that *proc_run* tasks are not spawned until *proc_start* is
  sent as response
- `InmemoryStreamWriteHalf` implementation of AsyncWrite now properly yields
  pending upon full channel and no longer locks up
- stdout, stderr, and stdin of `RemoteProcess` no longer cause deadlock
